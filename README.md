## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I live in the terminal; iTerm, alactritty, kitty usually, tmux and vim has been my main tools since 1993; tmux since 2012, at a time when I also started looking into neovim, moved to neovim as my main editor after Bram Moolenaar passed away.

I have no idea when I signed up for !gh, this profile appears to be a 2013 creation. Definitely no my first. I feel at home reading XSLT / c / cpp / objc / swift / php / bash / rust

My favorite language is Swift, but then again my favorite toolchain is cargo. Calling cargo a package manager does not do cargo justice.

I find it important to emphasize that `[neo]vi[m]` is not a text editor; `[neo]vi[m]` has a text editor in which is called `INSERT MODE`, and people loading nerd tree makes me cringe; FYI: there is telescope.

I have an ASCIINEMA profile the link is on the left; this is like gist meets youtube the TUI edition.

- ðŸ”­ I spent quite some time moving data in and out of FileMaker, postgreSQL, CoreData, elasticsearch, and other dataformats through CSV, TSV, binary formats, XML, JSON, YAML, other portable arrays, you name it.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 3 new startups; the technical parts
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning RataTUI for the CLI, Vapor for REST, Swift for Apple stuff
- ðŸŒ± I spent the first quarter of 2025 diving into Kubernetes, I can't say I like this more than Joyent SmartOS, yet it's a good thing to have in my toolbelt.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that brings the world forward
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stuff that will make you grow
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about parsing, pattern matching, and / or changing stuff
- ðŸ“« How to reach me telepathy
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Not my kind of juice, the junk in your trunk speaks for itself.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My first hack changed the colors of the cars in Burnin Rubber on the C64

Note `username` == `repositoryname` with a `README.md` I saw @orhun do this, I'm trying this too.

**TyrfingMjolnir/TyrfingMjolnir** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

In general I love stuff that fits in a table

| Column | header | more | of  | it  |
| ---    | ---    | ---  | --- | --- |
| Column | more   | of   |     | it  |

I know it's off the Richter's scale to put this here, yet I do. Lenovo P50 involuntary stuck in mute. Mine is on debian 12; this is how I fixed this:
```
apt install --reinstall pulseaudio
```
this enabled `Fn + F1` to get out of involunetary mute. Now do yourself a favor and do not push the mute button on top of the numeric keypad ever again.
