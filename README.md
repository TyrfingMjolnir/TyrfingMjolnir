## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I live in the terminal; iTerm, alactritty, urxvt, kitty usually, tmux and vim has been my main tools since 1993; tmux since 2012, at a time when I also started looking into neovim, moved to neovim as my main editor after Bram Moolenaar passed.

I have no idea when I signed up for !gh, this profile appears to be a 2013 creation. Definitely not my first. I feel at home reading XSLT / c / cpp / objc / swift / php / python / BASh / rust

My favorite language is Swift, but then again my favorite toolchain is cargo. Calling cargo a package manager does not do cargo justice.

I find it important to emphasize that `[neo]vi[m]` is not a text editor; `[neo]vi[m]` has a text editor in which is called `INSERT MODE`, and people loading nerd tree makes me cringe; FYI: there is telescope.

I have an ASCIINEMA profile the link is on the left; this is like gist meets youtube the TUI edition.

- ðŸ”­ I spent quite some time moving data in and out of FileMaker, postgreSQL, CoreData, elasticsearch, and other dataformats through CSV, TSV, binary formats, XML( in particular UBL / EHF, MTML, MXML, OAG, amongst others, ) JSON, YAML, other portable arrays, you name it.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on new startups; the technical parts
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still learning RataTUI for the CLI, Vapor for REST, Swift for Apple stuff
- ðŸŒ± I spent the first quarter of 2025 doing a deep dive into Kubernetes, I can't say I like this more than Joyent SmartOS, yet it's a good thing to have in my toolbelt.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that brings the world forward
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with stuff that will make you grow
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about parsing, pattern matching, and / or changing stuff
- ðŸ“« How to reach me telepathy
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Not my kind of juice, the junk in your trunk speaks for itself.

Note `username` == `repositoryname` with a `README.md` I saw @orhun do this, I'm trying this too.

**TyrfingMjolnir/TyrfingMjolnir** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

In general I love stuff that fits in a table

| Column | header | more | of  | it  |
| ---    | ---    | ---  | --- | --- |
| Column | more   | of   |     | it  |

I know it's off the Richter's scale to put this here, yet I do. Lenovo P50 involuntary stuck in mute. Mine is on debian 12; this is how I fixed this:
```
apt install --reinstall pulseaudio
```
this enabled `Fn + F1` to get out of involunetary mute. Now do yourself a favor and do not push the mute button on top of the numeric keypad ever again.
On 2nd thought I have to do the reinstall above on evert reboot. I should never have had pushed that mute button in the first place.
